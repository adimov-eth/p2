# Roadmap

**Fairlayer starts as entirely centralized network**, just like any PoW cryptocurrency. There are 4 validators having 25 shares each. 99 shares are guaranteed to be distributed within first 2 years to public identities 1-for-1 with verified social presence. After that the 100 validators must bring on 9900 more validators over next 5-10 years (onboarding 3 at a time) reaching our goal of 10k validators with **practically unhackable attack surface and 3333 entities Byzantine tolerance.**

Originally there will be only 1 verified bank in order to smooth the initial UX, support first users and collect necessary analytics. As soon as we have strong understanding how to make the bank and the rebalances more effective, everyone will be allowed to register their own bank and the topology of banks will grow organically (perhaps even turning into mesh at times).

Our priority is to get **just two things right** at genesis:

- secure state channels - to let users see and use the killer feature from day one

- reliable smart updates - everything else can be added with governance afterwards

Coming next:

- Web and mobile wallets

- Alternative full-node software

- Fair Names / domains

- Fair Login

- Atomic Multipath Payments

- Backup servers for encrypted dispute proofs

- Watchtowers
