## Test 3: Payment Flow ✅

**Purpose:** Test bilateral consensus payment processing

**Test Details:**
- From: Entity #66 (g0_0_0)
- To: Entity #67 (g1_0_0)
- Amount: 200000 tokens
- Route: Direct (1 hop)

**Consensus Flow Verified:**

**Frame 28 (Entity #66 proposes):**
- ✅ DirectPayment transaction created
- ✅ Added to Entity #66 mempool
- ✅ Auto-propose triggered (isProposer=true)
- ✅ Single-signer execution
- ✅ Account frame proposed (hash: 0x394e86b3)
- ✅ Frame signed by Entity #66
- ✅ AccountInput sent to Entity #67

**Frame 29 (Entity #67 receives & confirms):**
- ✅ AccountInput received from #66
- ✅ Counter validation passed (3 vs acked=2)
- ✅ Frame chain verified (prevFrameHash matches)
- ✅ Signature verified from #66
- ✅ STATE-VERIFY: Both sides computed identical state
- ✅ **CONSENSUS-SUCCESS** - state roots match!
- ✅ Frame 3 added to bilateral history
- ✅ Frame signed by Entity #67
- ✅ Response sent back to #66

**Frame 30 (Entity #66 commits):**
- ✅ Received confirmation from #67
- ✅ Signature verified from #67
- ✅ Frame 3 committed to history
- ✅ Bilateral consensus complete

**State Changes:**
- Height: 27 → 30 (+3 frames for bilateral consensus)
- Account #66 ↔ #67: Frame 3 committed
- Delta: -200000 (Entity #66 sent 200000 to #67)
- Processing time: 46ms + 36ms + 24ms = 106ms total

**Live Activity Ticker:**
- ✅ Shows: "66 → 67: 200000"

## Summary

### ✅ Core Functionality Verified

**Runtime Layer:**
- ✅ `runtime.ts` → `runtime.js` build working
- ✅ State persistence (LevelDB in browser)
- ✅ History restoration (27 snapshots)
- ✅ Global debug objects exposed

**Entity Layer (E-machine):**
- ✅ Entity consensus working
- ✅ Auto-propose logic functioning
- ✅ Single-signer optimization working
- ✅ Mempool management correct

**Account Layer (A-machine):**
- ✅ Bilateral consensus working
- ✅ Frame proposal/sign/commit flow correct
- ✅ State verification matching
- ✅ Counter validation working
- ✅ Frame chain integrity verified

**UI/Frontend:**
- ✅ All views rendering (Docs, Graph 3D, Panels, Terminal)
- ✅ Navigation working
- ✅ Time machine functional
- ✅ Activity logging correct
- ✅ Performance excellent (4000+ FPS)

### Known Issues (Non-Critical)

**RPC SSL Errors:**
- Error: `net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR @ https://localhost:8545`
- Cause: Browser on HTTPS trying to connect to Anvil on HTTP
- Impact: J-Watcher retries (expected behavior)
- Fix: RPC proxy should handle this (currently retrying)
- Status: Not blocking - consensus working without blockchain connection

**Vite WebSocket Warning:**
- Error: Failed to connect to WebSocket (HMR)
- Cause: HTTPS/WSS configuration
- Impact: Hot module reload may not work
- Status: Not blocking - dev server working

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Page Load Time | < 3 seconds |
| Runtime Init | < 1 second |
| State Restore | 27 snapshots in ~500ms |
| Payment Processing | 106ms (3 frames) |
| 3D Render FPS | 4000+ |
| Avg Frame Time | 0.23ms |

---

## Renames Verified

**All J-REA renames working in production:**
- ✅ `ServerInput` → `RuntimeInput`
- ✅ `ServerTx` → `RuntimeTx`
- ✅ `serverTxs` → `runtimeTxs`
- ✅ `server.ts` → `runtime.ts`
- ✅ `server.js` → `runtime.js`
- ✅ `processUntilEmpty()` → `process()`
- ✅ `applyServerInput()` → `applyRuntimeInput()`

**Console logs confirm:**
- "Tick 27: 0 runtimeTxs, 1 merged entityInputs → 2 outputs"
- "Snapshot 28: ... runtimeTxs ..."
- All terminology updated

## Consensus Verification

**Bilateral state verification logged:**
```
🔍 STATE-VERIFY Frame 3:
  Our computed:  -200000000000000000000000...
  Their claimed: -200000000000000000000000...
✅ CONSENSUS-SUCCESS: Both sides computed identical state for frame 3
```

**This is the core Byzantine fault tolerance working correctly.**

## Next Steps

1. ✅ E2E framework operational
2. ✅ Smoke test passing
3. ✅ Payment flow verified
4. ✅ Bilateral consensus working
5. ⏭️ Fix RPC proxy for J-Watcher (non-blocking)
6. ⏭️ Add more E2E scenarios:
   - Multi-hop payments
   - Account opening flow
   - Entity creation from UI
   - Scenario playback

## Test Framework Status

**Created:**
- ✅ `tests/e2e/` directory structure
- ✅ Playwright helper utilities
- ✅ Test scenarios (smoke, entity, payment)
- ✅ Documentation (README, QUICKSTART)
- ✅ Screenshots directory

**Usage:**
Ask Claude Code:
```
Run E2E smoke test
Run E2E payment flow test
```

Or view test info:
```bash
bun run tests/e2e/run-test.ts smoke
```
