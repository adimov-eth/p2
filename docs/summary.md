XLN Protocol â€” Summary

Core Concepts

XLN is a sovereign Layer2 for EVM, designed around two primitives:
	1.	Reserves â€” liquid balances held directly in the jurisdiction machine (J).
	2.	Reserve-credit accounts (channels) â€” bilateral credit contracts between entities, backed by collateral + deltas.

Every channel for a given asset is defined by three numbers:
	â€¢	Deposit (Collateral) â€” the locked base amount in the jurisdiction.
	â€¢	LedgerShift (ondelta) â€” a public shift recorded in J, changed by cooperative settle.
	â€¢	PrivateShift (offdelta) â€” a private shift stored in AccountProof, changed by subcontracts.

The invariant:

Î” = ondelta + offdelta

AccountProof

An AccountProof is the signed canonical state of a bilateral account:

[Left, Right, Seq, DeltaList, Subcontracts, Signature]

	â€¢	DeltaList: asset deltas (offdelta).
	â€¢	Subcontracts: optional executable logic (HTLC, Swap, CDS, etc.).
	â€¢	Signature: canonical signature by both sides.
Both parties hold the same canonical proof copy.

Dispute and Delta Derivation

When a dispute is triggered, the jurisdiction machine runs the following pipeline:
	1.	Sum Deltas
For each asset:

Î” = ondelta (public) + offdelta (from AccountProof)


	2.	Execute Subcontracts
Î” values are passed through the external Subcontract array, with inputs (arguments, deadlines, secrets, swap ratios, etc.).
The subcontract provider returns a modified DeltaList, producing the final effective Î”.
	3.	Split Collateral
With the final Î” values:
	â€¢	If 0 â‰¤ Î” â‰¤ deposit: left receives Î”, right receives (deposit âˆ’ Î”).
	â€¢	If Î” > deposit: left takes full deposit, surplus becomes debt of right.
	â€¢	If Î” < 0: right takes full deposit, surplus becomes debt of left.
	4.	Debt Enforcement
Debt is first covered from reserves. If reserves are insufficient, it is added to the entityâ€™s active debt list.

This ensures mechanical, deterministic settlement without third-party trust.

Asset Flow
	1.	From Jurisdiction Reserve
Assets are first deposited into reserves (reserves[entity][asset]).
	2.	From Reserve to Collateral
Entities can transfer reserves into channel collateral (collaterals[left][right][asset]).
	â€¢	By default, new collateral is attributed to the right.
	â€¢	If the depositor is left, ondelta is increased by the deposit amount (shifting allocation left).
	3.	Cooperative Settle
Both parties can jointly sign a settle transaction to update reserves, collateral, and ondelta atomically.
The invariant leftDiff + rightDiff + collateralDiff == 0 ensures conservation.

Event Propagation
	â€¢	Jurisdiction Machine (J) emits events for deposits, withdrawals, disputes, and finalizations.
	â€¢	Entity Machines (E) subscribe to J events to update their internal state.
	â€¢	Entities gossip AccountProofs between each other, ensuring canonical sequence numbers (seq).

Thus, entities always track both on-chain public state (ondelta + reserves) and off-chain private state (AccountProof).

First Payment Flow (Happy Path)
	1.	Initial Channel
Alice and Hub (H1) open a USDT channel with:

deposit = 100, ondelta = 0, offdelta = 0


	2.	Alice Sends 30 USDT
	â€¢	Alice builds an AccountProof: offdelta[USDT] = -30.
	â€¢	She signs and sends it to Hub.
	â€¢	Hub verifies signature, credit limit, and stores the proof.
	3.	Routing
	â€¢	Hub immediately uses its own channel (H1 â†’ Bob) to forward +30.
	â€¢	This creates a second proof in the (H1, Bob) channel.
	4.	State After Payment
	â€¢	Both Alice and Hub hold the same updated proof for (Alice, H1).
	â€¢	No settlement with jurisdiction required.
	â€¢	Reserves and deposits remain untouched until either cooperative settle or dispute.

Key Properties
	â€¢	Unicast DeFi â€” all payments are bilateral, no global sequencer.
	â€¢	Billions+ TPS â€” parallel channels scale unbounded.
	â€¢	Zero DA risk â€” no dependence on external data storage.
	â€¢	Fully sovereign exits â€” any user can exit with just their AccountProof.
	â€¢	Programmable subcontracts â€” advanced logic (HTLC, swaps, derivatives) run off-chain, enforced on dispute.
	â€¢	Simple as banking â€” user balances are derived from (deposit, ondelta, offdelta) transparently.

ðŸ“Œ This structure makes XLN mathematically minimal:
	â€¢	One deposit
	â€¢	Two deltas
	â€¢	One invariant equation

From this, all forms of payments, credit, swaps, and disputes are derived.
