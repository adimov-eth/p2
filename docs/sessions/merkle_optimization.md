# Merkle Tree Optimization Session

## Key Decisions

### Accepted Designs
1. Configurable Bit Width
   - What: Allow configurable bit width (1-16 bits) for path chunking
   - Why: Balance between tree depth and branching factor
   - Implementation: 
     - Configurable in TreeConfig
     - Default 4-bit nibbles for most cases
     - 8-bit for high-performance scenarios
   - Performance targets: 
     - Support 10k+ signers
     - Handle 10k+ entities per signer
     - Sub-50ms path lookups

2. Dynamic Node Splitting
   - What: Split leaf nodes when they exceed threshold
   - Why: Maintain balanced tree structure
   - Implementation:
     - Configurable threshold (1-1024)
     - Automatic splitting on insert
     - Hash caching for performance
   - Performance targets:
     - < 1ms split operation
     - < 100ms for 1000 concurrent updates

### Declined Alternatives
1. Fixed Bit Width
   - What: Use fixed 8-bit chunks for all paths
   - Why declined: Less flexible for different use cases
   - Tradeoffs considered:
     - Pros: 
       - Simpler implementation
       - Potentially faster path parsing
     - Cons:
       - No optimization for different scenarios
       - Higher memory usage in some cases
   - Future considerations: May revisit for specialized high-performance cases

2. Separate Trees per Type
   - What: Use different trees for each storage type
   - Why declined: Increased complexity and storage overhead
   - Tradeoffs considered:
     - Pros:
       - Better isolation
       - Simpler per-type operations
     - Cons:
       - More memory usage
       - Complex root calculation
       - Harder to maintain consistency
   - Future considerations: Could be useful for sharding
