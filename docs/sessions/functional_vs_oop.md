# Session Analysis: Functional vs OOP Architecture

## Key Decisions

### Accepted Designs
1. Hybrid Approach with Functional Core
   - What: Use pure functions for core logic, limited classes for services
   - Why: Financial systems need predictable, auditable state transitions
   - Implementation: 
     - Pure functions for state transitions
     - Classes only for long-lived services (P2P, SwapEngine)
   - Performance targets: Minimal overhead, clear state flow

### Declined Alternatives
1. Pure OOP Approach
   - What: Everything as classes
   - Why declined: Too much hidden state, harder to audit
   - Tradeoffs considered:
     - Pros: Natural encapsulation, familiar patterns
     - Cons: Hidden state, harder testing, complex inheritance
   - Future considerations: May need more classes as system grows

## Technical Insights

### Performance Optimizations
- Keep state transitions pure and simple
- Minimize hidden state
- Clear data flow paths

### Edge Cases
- Complex stateful services need careful management
- Cross-channel synchronization
- State proof generation

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Components
1. Core State Machine
   - Pure functional approach
   - Immutable state updates
   - Explicit state transitions

2. Services Layer
   - Limited use of classes
   - Clear lifecycle management
   - Stateful service isolation

### Integration Points
- State transitions â†’ Service layer
- P2P networking
- Storage systems

## Future Considerations
- May need more classes as complexity grows
- Keep monitoring state management overhead
- Consider formal verification of core functions

## Questions for Next Session
- Specific service class boundaries?
- State synchronization patterns?
- Testing strategy for hybrid approach?
