## Example Session: Buffer/TypeScript Integration

### Accepted Designs
1. Buffer Type Safety
   - What: Consistent Buffer handling with explicit type checks
   - Why: Prevent type mismatches between Buffer and Uint8Array
   - Implementation:
     ```typescript
     // Safe pattern
     const encoded = Buffer.from(encode(data));
     
     // Type guard
     function isValidTx(input: EntityInput): input is { type: 'AddEntityTx', tx: Buffer } {
       return input.type === 'AddEntityTx' && Buffer.isBuffer(input.tx);
     }
     ```
   - Performance targets: Minimal overhead from type checks

### Declined Alternatives
1. Type Assertions
   - What: Using type assertions (`as Buffer`) for RLP encoded data
   - Why declined: Unsafe at runtime, masks potential bugs
   - Tradeoffs considered:
     - Pros: Less code, simpler implementation
     - Cons: Runtime errors, type safety issues
   - Future considerations: May revisit if TypeScript improves type narrowing

### Performance Optimizations
- Use `Buffer.from()` consistently
- Batch database operations
- Cache merkle roots
- Minimize type conversions

### Edge Cases
- RLP encoding returning Uint8Array
- Mixed Buffer/Uint8Array in merkle trees
- Nested buffer conversions in complex objects

### Critical Components
1. Entity State Encoding
   - Validate all decoded data
   - Handle nested buffers
   - Test with large datasets

2. Merkle Store Integration
   - Buffer consistency in tree nodes
   - Hash computation with correct types
   - Performance with large trees

### Integration Points
- RLP encoding/decoding
- WebSocket message handling
- Database operations
- Merkle tree operations

## Future Considerations
- Native ESM support improvements
- Better TypeScript/Node.js integration
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Enhanced type safety features
