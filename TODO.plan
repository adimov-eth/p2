TODO Plan – Prime Eleventy Project

1. Environment & Baseline
   - Pull latest `codex/complete-eleventy-migration-and-tooling` and install deps (`cd site && npm install`).
   - Run `npm run build`, `npm run test:links`, `npm run test:html` to confirm baseline passes before edits.

2. Source-of-Truth Audit
   - Compare Eleventy pages in `site/` against `HTML_DRAFTS/` to verify every draft page exists and content aligns with the unified navigation.
   - Note any missing sections, mismatched copy (price/rounds/emails), or styling gaps for follow-up.

3. Premium Polish & Consistency
   - Review each public page (white vs blue backgrounds) to ensure consistent premium look-and-feel; adjust heroArt usage, color tokens, and typography if mismatched.
   - Confirm navigation across home/pricing/contact/incentives/internal pages is intuitive; fix broken or buried links.

4. Documentation & Contributor Experience
   - Draft `AGENTS.md` contributor guide (follow 200–400 word brief, reference key commands and structure).
   - Update README or related docs if new tooling or workflows emerge.

5. QA & Regression Safety
   - After changes, rerun `npm run build`, `npm run test:links`, and `npm run test:html`.
   - Spot-check visual diffs locally; capture notes/screens where layout improvements were made.

6. Git Hygiene & Delivery
   - Stage and commit with clear conventional messages (e.g., `docs: add contributor guide`).
   - Push to origin branch; open/update PR #3 with summary, testing proof, and screenshots if UI changes.

7. Post-Delivery Follow-ups
   - Create GitHub issue describing remaining tasks (visual QA, potential Playwright baseline, analytics toggle).
   - Plan next enhancements (map embed on contact page, expanded dashboards, bilingual content) and note prerequisites.
