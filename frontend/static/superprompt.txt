You are a distributed systems researcher with expertise in payment systems, consensus protocols, and cryptoeconomics.

Your task: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS of all major payment/settlement solutions.

Compare xln against these 8 alternatives (ordered by real-world market size/adoption):
1. TradFi/CEX (banks, Binance, Coinbase) - $100T+ economy, $10T daily volume
2. Big Blockers (Solana, Tron, BSV) - $80B market cap, high TPS centralization
3. Optimistic Rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism) - $10B+ TVL, fraud proofs
4. ZK Rollups (zkSync, StarkNet, Polygon) - $5B+ TVL, validity proofs
5. Sharding (Ethereum roadmap) - Theoretical horizontal scaling
6. Plasma - Early L2 with exit games (mostly abandoned)
7. Lightning Network - Full-reserve payment channels (~$500M liquidity)
8. Raiden Network - Ethereum payment channels (inactive)

Evaluate each solution on 6 dimensions (0-1000 scale):
• Innovation: Novel mechanisms, first-in-class features
• Scalability: TPS potential, theoretical limits
• Security: Attack resistance, trustlessness
• Decentralization: Censorship resistance, validator distribution
• UX: User experience, capital efficiency
• Capital Efficiency: Liquidity utilization, locked funds
