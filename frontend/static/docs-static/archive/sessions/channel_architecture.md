# Session Analysis: Channel & Swap Design

## Key Decisions

### Accepted Designs
1. Channels as Submachines
   - What: Channels operate within entities as independent state machines
   - Why: Enables local-first operations with global settlement
   - Implementation: 
     - Each entity manages multiple channels
     - Cross-channel atomic swaps
     - Local execution, global verification

### Critical Components
1. Channel Structure
   - Independent state machines
   - Balance tracking
   - Participant signatures
   - Cross-channel commitments

2. Swap Mechanism
   - Intent matching system
   - Hash timelock contracts
   - Atomic execution
   - Dispute resolution

## Technical Insights

### Core Flow
- Channels create swap intents
- Entities match compatible intents
- Atomic cross-channel execution
- Cryptographic proofs maintain safety

### Edge Cases
- Timeout handling
- Incomplete swaps
- Dispute resolution
- State synchronization

## Future Considerations
- Multi-party swaps
- Cross-network settlement
- Liquidity optimization
- Network effect scaling

## Questions for Next Session
- Optimal intent matching algorithm?
- Timeout parameters?
- Proof structure for swaps?
