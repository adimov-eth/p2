# Session Analysis: Core Development Principles

## Key Decisions

### Accepted Approach
1. Functional Core, Service Shell
   - What: Pure functions for core logic, minimal classes for services
   - Why: Financial systems need perfect auditability
   - Implementation:
     - Core state transitions are pure functions
     - Services (P2P, DB) can be classes
     - No hidden state in critical paths

### Code Style 
1. Core Logic (Pure Functions)
   - Explicit state transitions
   - No side effects
   - Clear data flow
   - Everything is provable

2. Service Layer (Minimal Classes)
   - Long-lived resources (DB, Network)
   - Clear lifecycle management
   - Isolated from core logic
   - Stateful but contained

## Technical Insights

### Why This Hybrid Approach
- Financial code must be auditable
- State transitions must be predictable
- Services need lifecycle management
- Balance pragmatism with safety

### Critical Principles
- Start small, perfect execution
- No premature optimization
- Every state change must be provable
- Test everything extensively

## Implementation Notes
- Keep core logic pure
- Explicit state transitions
- Clear data flow
- Minimal dependencies

## Future Considerations
- May need more services as we scale
- Keep monitoring complexity
- Stay focused on correctness

## Questions for Next Session
- First component to implement?
- Test strategy for pure functions?
- Service boundaries?
