# Session Analysis: Financial Infrastructure Scale

## Key Decisions

### Accepted Designs
1. Conservative Growth Strategy
   - What: Start small with perfect execution
   - Why: Building financial infrastructure requires trust
   - Implementation: 
     - Focus on basic asset transfers first
     - Rigorous security and auditing
   - Performance targets: Correctness over speed

### Critical Components
1. Core Financial Primitives (~2000 LOC)
   - Entity/channel state machines
   - Validation and proofs
   - Asset management
   - Consensus logic

2. Infrastructure Layer (~3000 LOC)
   - Storage and indexing
   - P2P networking
   - API/Integration

## Technical Insights

### Safety Requirements
- Immutable audit trails
- Cryptographic proofs for all operations
- Zero trust architecture
- Formal verification where critical
- Regulatory compliance from day one

### Edge Cases
- Cross-depository operations
- Atomic swaps
- Settlement disputes
- State synchronization

## Implementation Notes
- Use bigint for financial calculations
- Every state change must be provable
- Conservative feature rollout
- Multiple independent audits

## Future Considerations
- Regulatory requirements
- Cross-border operations
- Scaling considerations
- Audit requirements

## Questions for Next Session
- Detailed regulatory compliance strategy?
- Audit trail implementation?
- Cross-border settlement approach?
